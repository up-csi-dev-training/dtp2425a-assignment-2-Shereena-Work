Osorezan Revoir

Throughout these thousand years
I have finally learned how to let go of this sadness
Even if it is ever so fleeting, even if it is ever so fleeting

This weak heart of mine
I can finally let go of this heavy burden of mine
Even without a grave, even without a grave

I have distanced myself from the crowds for such a long time and gone through much solitude 
Hence I was very delighted to meet you during the New Year.

Love is an encounter
A departure
A transparent piece of veil
Let us meet a Mount Osore

Although I have turned my back against you
But I have felt nothing but utmost happiness throughout this journey with you
It’s alright if you think that I have acted heartlessly
But can you greet me with a smile the next time we meet?

This song is barely capable of delivering my feelings of admire
Yet, it must end here, once and for all

I wonder, what that shining country above me is
I wonder, what that shining land above me is
I suppose it’s where Jizou-sama sits

Love is an encounter
A departure
A transparent piece of veil
Let us meet at Mount Osore
Let us meet again at Mount Osore
