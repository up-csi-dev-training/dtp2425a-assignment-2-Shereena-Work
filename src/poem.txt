Throughout these thousand years
I have finally learned how to let go of this sadness
Even if it is ever so fleeting
Even if it is ever so fleeting

This weak heart of mine
I can finally let go of this heavy burden of mine
Even without a grave
Even without a grave

I have distanced myself from the crowds for such a long time and gone through much solitude 
Hence I was very delighted to meet you during the New Year.

Love is an encounter
A departure
A transparent piece of veil
Let us meet a Mount Osore

Although I have turned my back against you
But I have felt nothing but utmost happiness throughout this journey with you
It’s alright if you think that I have acted heartlessly
But can you greet me with a smile the next time we meet?

This song is barely capable of delivering my feelings of admire
Yet, it must end here, once and for all

I wonder, what that shining country above me is
I wonder, what that shining land above me is
I suppose it’s where Jizou-sama sits

Love is an encounter
A departure
A transparent piece of veil
Let us meet at Mount Osore

Let us meet again at Mount Osore

"Osorezan Revoir" by Megumi Hayashibara is an emotional and haunting song deeply tied to the anime Shaman King, where it reflects on themes of loss, reunion, and longing. The song's title, "Osorezan Revoir," refers to Osorezan, a sacred mountain in Japan often associated with the spiritual realm and the afterlife, and revoir, which means "goodbye" or "until we meet again" in French. This combination hints at a farewell rooted in hope for eventual reunion, giving the song a mystical and poignant tone.
